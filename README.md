# opencvtest1
A test on the opencv python lib

Most of the code here are slight adaptations of the ones in the 10 day crash course present at:

http://www.pyimagesearch.com/

I do recomend the course for anyone starting with opencv.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisities

What things you need to have to be able to run:

* python - v3.4+
* opencv - 3.1+

Some of the files also require a connected webcam.


### Installing


Installing opencv is not as easy as one would expect if you are unsure on how to do it check this post:
